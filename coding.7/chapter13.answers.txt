Question 2: Amount of memory in my system: 7960 MB, Amount free: 6329 MB
These numbers don't match my intuition because I always thought there would 
be more memory space in a system; like I would think at least 1 GB. My phone 
would not be able to run on a 1 GB memory space.
Question 4: <your answer>
Question 7: When I used the flag -X on some of the PID, there were little no detail provided for some of them (maybe, there were nothing much done
in that process). For some of them, there's a path shown as a result and other show what command was used. When I used the -d flag, the address 
space of that process was also shown which wasn't expected.
